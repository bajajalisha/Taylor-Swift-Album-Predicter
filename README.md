# Taylor Swift Album Predictor

### This project is split into three parts, Data Collection, Data Exploring, and Building Classifier. All parts are combines in main.ipynb.

### For the project, I used scikit-learn to make a naive-Bayes classifier to predict the Taylor Swift album a song belongs in. I plan to make a web application for this project, so anyone can see where any song would belong in Taylor Swift's repetoire.

With the recent excitement around and success of Taylor Swift's re-released albums, I wanted to look at whether these albums could be distinguished by their lyrics. Especially since there are songs written for the original album but are only now released, it would be interesting to see if these songs still sound like the album they were originally meant for.

Although I also webscraped the lyrics, I felt more comfortable showing/using someone else' prepared dataset for the remainder of the project.
